Modern real-time scheduling theory was started by Professor David Liu at UIUC with his seminal paper [Scheduling Algorithms for Multiprogramming in a Hard Real-Time Environment](http://www.newslab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/course/rts2011/papers/Scheduling%20Algorithms%20for%20Multiprogramming%20in%20%20a%20Hard-Real-Time%20Environment%20.pdf).
Built upon this pioneering work, Professor Lui Sha and his collaborators created the modern real-time scheduling theory that transformed the real-time computing standards and impacted [many national high technology projects](http://publish.illinois.edu/cpsintegrationlab/files/2012/02/Space.pdf).
