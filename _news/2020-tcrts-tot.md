Lui Sha was among six publications recognized by the IEEE Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems with the 2020 Test of Time and Influential Paper Awards. His landmark 1990 paper, “Priority Inheritance Protocols: An Approach to Real-Time Synchronization,” was one of four papers recognized with a 2020 Real-Time Systems Test-of-Time Award. The paper introduced the now-standard methods for controlling priority inversion on uniprocessors. Seven years after it was published, this work played a critical role in the Mars Pathfinder mission.
